# PixieDust âœ¨ - High throughput image processing application
PixieDust is a quick and dirty solution to process common image formats into WebP (with support for animated webp too) and optionally crop them with in a quick and simple way. I designed this project mainly as a POC for Nerimity as their current solution can cause CDN crashes, however this is pretty simple to use and edit for your own projects. (hi superkitten wsg pooks)

Due to the project's use of `discord/lilliput` for the compression, this project only supports OSX/Linux.

## Usage:
> ./pixiedust --help
